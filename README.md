The Alibaba Cloud AS02MC04 is an FPGA accelerator board previously used as a cloud compute resource and now available inexpensively on eBay. It contains a Xilinx xcku3p-ffvb676-1-e FPGA, which excitingly is the largest Kintex Ultrascale+ supported by the free tier of Vivado (as of the start of 2026). Its external connectivity is two 10/25 GigE SFP+ cages and PCIe Gen 3 x8 on a standard PC PCIe connector. There is a populated standard JTAG header easily accessible.

This repository is my collection of notes around bringing up the board and developing GNU Radio based applications with it.
